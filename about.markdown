Hi, I’m Brendon!

This site is where I share notes, resources, code snippets, and lessons learned as I grow my skills as a software developer.

Thanks for visiting — feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/donjella) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brendon-ang).
